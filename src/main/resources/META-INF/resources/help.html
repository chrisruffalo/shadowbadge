                <h2 class="mt-5">General Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    The Shadowbadge firmware and software are based around the <a href="https://github.com/sqfmi/badgy">Badgy</a>
                    device in a B/W/R (black, white, and red) screen configuration.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Controls</h2>
                <p>
                    There is a five-way switch on the front of the Badgy that is used to give rudimentary input commands
                    during operation. While we hope to expand this to an actual menu system this is enough to give basic
                    input capabilities at this stage. The controls only apply to a Badgy device running the Shadowbadge
                    firmware.
                </p>
                <p><img class="img-fluid" style="width: 50%" src="/img/shadowbadge_large.jpg"></p>
                <p>
                    All control inputs are given facing the device with the five-way switch to the <em>right</em> of the
                    screen. The controls can be used to perform a variety of actions at
                    power-on. <strong>All directions/controls are based on the device being oriented as in the picture above.</strong>
                </p>
                <h6>During Power On</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Up: Completely forget all settings, both wifi and device</li>
                    <li>Right: Forget wifi settings</li>
                    <li>
                        Center: Put the device into refresh mode immediately (pulls configuration from this
                        web application)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Left: Put the device into OTA update mode to allow new firmware to be used
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Or during the normal operation of the device.
                </p>
                <h6>While the Device is On</h6>
                <ul>
                    <li>Center: Put the device into refresh mode until an update happens</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Getting the Firmware</h2>
                <p>
                    You can download the current version of the Shadowbadge firmware for the Badge device from the
                    <a href="/downloads.html">downloads page</a>. The version hosted there is intended for use with
                    the current version of the Shadowbadge web application. This firmware is a binary file that needs
                    to be loaded onto the Badgy device.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Loading the Firmware</h2>
                <p>
                    If you are using the default Badgy firmware then you can enter the OTA (over the air) update mode
                    by holding down the center button on the five-way switch as you slide the device from the "off" to
                    the "on" position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are using Shadowbadge firmware to enter OTA update mode the five-way switch needs to be held
                    in the <em>>left</em> (toward the device's screen) position as the device is powered on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you are in OTA mode you can connect to the access point provided by the Badgy's WiFi with the
                    on-screen details. The Badgy device (in either firmware) will need to be connected to a wifi network
                    in before you can connect to the update server.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Connecting to Wifi</h2>
                <p>
                    When using any firmware (Badgy default or Shadowbadge) the device will remember the last AP that you
                    connected it to. If it cannot find or connect to that AP it will show a screen with details for
                    connecting to the device's AP which will provide you with a captive-portal webpage you can then
                    use to connect the device to a local AP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When using the Shadowbadge firmware the AP's SSID and password are generated so that you must be
                    in view of the screen to connect. To make this process faster a QR code is displayed that some devices
                    can scan to connect to the AP.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once connected to the device's AP a captive-portal page will be displayed and you will be able to
                    connect to the page and scan for local access points and configure the device's wifi.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Claiming the Badge</h2>
                <p>
                    When the device is powered on for the first time with the Shadowbadge firmware it needs to be claimed
                    (registered to a given user) before it can be configured. (Also, after a settings reset.) Before
                    the device can be claimed it needs to connect to wifi.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When the device is connected to Wifi and ready to be claimed it will show a screen with a QR code
                    that can be scanned in order to claim the badge. This will take you through the process to register
                    with Shadowbadge (if you have not already) and then claim the badge for you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once the badge is claimed the screen will change to show the claim status. The name of the badge
                    will be the same as the AP name during installation and will be shown in your browser and on the
                    badge details screen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you are on the badge details screen you can configure the badge to your specifications.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Configuring the Badge</h2>
                <p>
                    The Shadowbadge web application provides a form for configuring various information that will be
                    shown in the standard layout of the badge. This includes the icon, the header (your name), and
                    other lines on the badge. The web UI will provide suggestions for these fields but feel free to be
                    <em>appropriately</em> creative.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Unclaiming a Badge</h2>
                <p>
                    In the Shadowbadge web application you have the ability to "unclaim" a badge. This is useful if you
                    want to pass the badge to someone else. Once you click "unclaim" and then "unclaim" again the badge will
                    be removed from your list of badges.
                <p>
                    Next time the badge updates it will revert to claim mode and be ready to be scanned and claimed. This may
                    require that you put the badge in "refresh" mode either by holding the center button and turing the unit on
                    or, if the unit is already on, pressing the center button to trigger a refresh cycle.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Resetting a Badge</h2>
                <p>
                    Holding "up" on the badge's five-way joystick will cause the badge to reset during boot. It will "forget"
                    all of the wifi settings and the configuration it previously downloaded from the Shadowbadge server.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mt-5">Power Optimization</h2>
                <p>
                    While the Badgy device is power efficient the best way to conserve power is to allow the device to update and
                    then turn it off. The screen will stay sharp for 24-48 hours or so before it fades some and needs to be
                    updated again.
